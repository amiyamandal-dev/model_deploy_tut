A former prison nurse who had an affair with a convicted rapist at a top security jail has been ordered to be struck off the nursing register. Married Karen Cosford had a relationship lasting several months with Brian McBride, who was serving a life sentence at Wakefield Prison, West Yorkshire. She denied any wrongdoing at a trial in 2012 but was found guilty of misconduct by engaging in a sexual relationship with an inmate and was jailed for three years. Cosford, 49, of Normanton, Wakefield, was also found guilty of failing to tell prison authorities that McBride had a mobile phone and bringing in top-ups for the prisoner. Today she was barred from practising as a nurse by medical body, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), following her release from prison last November. At her trial, Cosford, who worked in the jail's medical centre, claimed McBride, who is serving life for multiple offences of rape and violence, raped her then intimidated her so she would not report it. But jurors at Leeds Crown Court rejected the claim after hearing how she became inappropriately close to McBride, after he duped her into thinking he had wealth on the outside, and started a sexual relationship. The pair had met as he had a job as a cleaner in the healthcare centre, the court heard. During the trial, the court heard how other officers had stood guard while she went to McBride's cell for sex. She had also written him a love letter, which was found in a bag of sugar. Cosford was jailed over the fling, during which she turned a blind eye to rapist Brian McBride's mobile phone use, but was released last year. An NMC fitness to practise panel in London has now heard that Cosford sent an email last month in which she stated that she felt 'it would be a fruitless exercise to continue fighting to clear my name with the NMC. I hope this will allow you to progress without any further disruption</td>\n",

The Nobel Peace Prize laureate, 76, faced widespread condemnation this morning after he told the American news network CNN he believed there was merit in the idea of different ethnic groups living apart. Mr De Klerk told CNN that the idea of ethnic communities being separated, as under apartheid, was 'not repugnant'. FW de Klerk spoke on CNN, saying the idea of separated ethnic communities was not repugnant. He added that black people were not deprived of power under the apartheid regime, saying: 'They were not disenfranchised, they voted' FW de Klerk and Nelson Mandela addressing crowds after Mandela's inauguration in 1994. The former president served as South Africa's last white leader before the advent of democracy in 1994, and served as deputy president under Nelson Mandela until 1996. He was asked by CNN reporter Christiane Amanpour whether he believed apartheid had been morally repugnant. He answered: 'In as much as it trampled human rights it was and remains morally indefensible. 'I have made the most profound apology in front of the Truth Commission and on other occasions about the injustices which were wrought by apartheid.' But he added: 'What I haven't apologised for is the original concept of seeking to bring justice to all South Africans through the concept of nation states. 'In South Africa it failed. By the end of the 70s we had to realise, and accept and admit to ourselves that it had failed. And that is when fundamental reform started.' Mr De Klerk made his remarks as he spoke to CNN in Chicago, where he has been attending a summit of Nobel laureates. The statesman was awarded the peace prize jointly with Nelson Mandela in 1993 after the pair negotiated a peaceful end to apartheid. Mr De Klerk's National Party had previously controlled a white minority government in South Africa from 1948 to 1994.

        "The past 12 months have been the worst for aviation fatalities so far this decade - with the total of number of people killed if airline crashes reaching 1,050 even before the Air Asia plane vanished. Two incidents involving Malaysia Airlines planes - one over eastern Ukraine and the other in the Indian Ocean - led to the deaths of 537 people, while an Air Algerie crash in Mali killed 116 and TransAsia Airways crash in Taiwan killed a further 49 people. The remaining 456 fatalities were largely in incidents involving small commercial planes or private aircraft operating on behalf of companies, governments or organisations. Despite 2014 having the highest number of fatalities so far this decade, the total number of crashes was in fact the lowest since the first commercial jet airliner took off in 1949 - totalling just 111 across the whole world over the past 12 months. The all-time deadliest year for aviation was 1972 when a staggering 2,429 people were killed in a total of 55 plane crashes - including the crash of Aeroflot Flight 217, which killed 174 people in Russia, and Convair 990 Coronado, which claimed 155 lives in Spain. However this year's total death count of 1,212, including those presumed dead on board the missing Air Asia flight, marks a significant rise on the very low 265 fatalities in 2013 - which led to it being named the safest year in aviation since the end of the Second World War. Scroll down for videos. Deadly: The past 12 months have been the worst for aviation fatalities so far this decade - with the total of number of people killed if airline crashes reaching 1,158 even before the Air Asia plane (pictured) vanished. Fatal: Two incidents involving Malaysia Airlines planes - one over eastern Ukraine (pictured) and the other in the Indian Ocean - led to the deaths of 537 people. Surprising: Despite 2014 having the highest number of fatalities so far this decade, the total number of crashes was in fact the lowest since the first commercial jet airliner took off in 1949. 2014 has been a horrific year for Malaysia-based airlines, with 537 people dying on Malaysia Airlines planes, and a further 162 people missing and feared dead in this week's Air Asia incident. In total more than half the people killed in aviation incidents this year had been flying on board Malaysia-registered planes. In January a total of 12 people lost their lives in five separate incidents, while the same number of crashes in February killed 107. \n",
